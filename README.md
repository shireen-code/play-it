# play-it
Javascript web application for searching movies using the OMDB api. 
In this web-application, users can search Movies by their name and can also get their detailed information from IMDb Website. I've used OMDB API to fetch the movies data. You can search a movie in the search bar and if results match then you will get the related movies else you will get an error message.
